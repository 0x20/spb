    <h2>Interaction: SPB vs. Gatekeeper</h2>

    <p>There are two ways in which SPB and Gatekeeper work together:
    <ol>
        <li>SPB provides the whitelist file for Gatekeeper.<br>
            The SPB API provides a rest call that sends a properly formatted whitelist file in its
            response. On the gatekeeper server, a cron job is configured that pulls this whitelist file
            from Gatekeeper at regular intervals (e.g. every 20 minutes). Gatekeeper will automatically
            reload this whitelist file when it detects a change.<br>
            If SPB is not accessible, the cron job will not update the whitelist file, and Gatekeeper
            will continue to use the last whitelist file it managed to pull from SPB.</li>
        <li>Gatekeeper sends log messages to SPB.<br>
            This makes it possible to view the Gatekeeper logs through the SPB UI.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
