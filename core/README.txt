CORE

- clone the git repository
- in the "spb" directory, run "virtualenv core". 
  This will turn "core" into a virtualenv, to which you can add packages.
- activate the "core" virtualenv:
  source bin/activate
- in "core", install flask:
  pip install flask
- in "core", install psycopg2:
  pip install psycopg2
  (if you get a message that it needs a path to pg_config, run something like this (on MacOSX):
   export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin:$PATH"
   on Debian (Linux) it may be something else. The pg_config program is part of the PostgreSQL install)
- Using ./Brain_API  you should be able to start the core API.

POSTGRESQL

Donâ€™t forget to install PostgreSQL on your PC. Use the properties in liquifies.properties to set up your database (DB name: smarterspacebrain, schema name: smarterspacebrain, role name: smarterspacebrain (pwd spbdev). If you choose different names, make sure to update liquibase.properties accordingly.

In order to update the database, execute:
  bin/run_liquibase.sh

(internally, this runs maven)
